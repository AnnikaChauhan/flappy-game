# flappy-game
A game built during game week at _nology. It is an attempt to recreate flappy bird, this was the first attempt at building an entire game from scratch. It is currently completing the bare principle of the game - the dragon falls but rises on a spacebar click and an obstacle moves across the screen, if they collide the game ends.

The game was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and does not need any additional packages to be run locally. 

Access to the live game is available [here](https://annikachauhan.github.io/flappy-game/).
